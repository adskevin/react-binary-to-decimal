## ReactJS Binary to Decimal Converter

This is an implementation of one of the beginner project ideas from [this repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

The original specs of this project are:

Allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
    sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for
    example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function
    to use.

My code was made based on theese User Stories:

-   User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

I also implemented this Bonus Feature:

-   User can enter a variable number of binary digits

And my own Bonus Features:

-   User can define a custom limit of digits to the input
-   User can clear the fields using a Clear button

## Gitpod

To easily try this project, you can use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Throught this [link](http://gitpod.io/#github.com/adskevin/react-binary-to-decimal), you can directly access this repository inside an web environment.

You just need to login with you Github and wait for `npm` to auto run `install`. After that, the preview will automatically show up in the right side of the screen.

You can see and edit the code inside Gitpod environment, so feel free to test and send me some feedback. I'm new to React, so this would help me a lot.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
